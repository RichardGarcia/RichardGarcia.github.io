				<h4>My Favorite website</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>Stack overflow</li>
					<li>Smashing Magazine</li>
					<li>Udemy</li>
				</ul>

				<p>My favorite... because these websites can help me to improve my programming skills. <br />You can get a lot of tutorials, videos, PDF books, samples, etc.. and you can also ask questions to other programmers too!</p><br />
				<p>It so easy to navigate the website, search address bar and navigational menu are always visible and you could use filters in searching for something... :)</p><br />
				<p>Checking Smashing magazine website again, If you stand up futher you could see the advertisement area which I think is not the most important area of the site. In Udemy site you could see featured course immeadiately at top part of the page which is good (most featured courses are for IT/Tecnology).</p><br />
				<p>How would you describe the website visually? <br /> <br />Stackoverflow, simple and basic<br />Smashing Magazine and Udemy is colorful and lively </p><br/>
				<p>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site?<br />
				<ul>
					<li>Informative</li>
					<li>Interesting</li>
					<li>Educational</li>
					<li>Newsy</li>
					<li>Useful</li>
				</ul>
