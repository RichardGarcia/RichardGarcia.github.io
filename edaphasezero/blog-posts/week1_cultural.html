				<h4>EDA...</h4>

				<p>I'm am really looking for a school where I can learn backend programming here in Wellington.. And I know that there's a lot of programmaming tutorials online but.. It really boreds me (sleepy).. like your just talking with your computer.. no interaction.. </p><br/>

				<p>Shereef video is very inspirational.. thats the ideal way to learn or teach.. I really like EDAs' way of teaching, the pairing or working within groups,  I think that way your not only learning how to code but you also developing your people skills and I'm really keen to participate in that kind of learning evironment. I'm really nervous.. scared.. I hope I could survived this boothcamp.</p><br/>

				<p>I also love to think that you will have a good balance life EDA, because of some added related extra-curricular activities while learning on how to do programing, you are not just reading documents, following step by step tutorials and ticking your keyboards 24/7.. </p>
