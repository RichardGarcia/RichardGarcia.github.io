		<p>Udemy and Smashing Magazine is a colourful, informative, interestingand lively (which they have an update almost everyday) website which you can learn a lot from.<br /><br />Checking the UI/Design part of Smashing Magazine, Main category (mobile, design, coding, graphics, etc) are sorted properly on the left side navigational menu where you can access which page to go and the sub-menu also helps filter or categorize topics you want to see.<br /><br />Udemy.com, which is similar to Smashing Magazine site, the course category on the left side part is an easy access and the sliding featured course on the top of page is also a good design idea. I also like the option that you can change the course details in list or grid view.  However, I read an article online (http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/12/29/10-web-design-trends-can-expect-see-2014/4/) that the current web design trend for 2014 would be having large areas or "hero areas" as they call it to replace sliders to grab attention. The challenge would be creating a simple and concise design to engage the user when visiting the site.</p>
